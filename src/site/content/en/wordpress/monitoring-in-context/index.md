As we have seen, being successful as a content creator on the web means being successful in each of the four phases of the [conversion funnel](/success-on-the-web-in-context/#conversion-funnels). We have also learned that several key pieces can lead to success in each of them, and one that encompasses all four phases is **website monitoring**.

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
Website monitoring is the measurement and collection of data that allows you to make informed decisions on your content and technical strategy, based on the current behavior of your site and its users.
{% endAside %}

Monitoring is key to knowing whether your website is giving you the expected results, whether these are of monetary, popular or any other other nature. You need to analyze what your users expect to find on your website and where you can optimize your content strategy to better address these needs. Just as much as you should measure your success _and_ analyze your users' (and potential conversions') behavior in a non-digital business, you need to do the same for your website.

## Types of monitoring

Monitoring itself is a broad term, and when it comes to your website, there are several pillars that you can (and should) be monitoring. One trait that all of these have in common is that monitoring should be happening continuously, throughout the entire lifecycle of your website. You should not track a certain metric for a few days and then stop once you are satisfied with the results.

Each of the different monitoring pillars is either based on your site itself or how users behave on your site, so these are essentially the two types of website monitoring that can be differentiated between. For this article, we are going to have a brief look at both of them, and then focus closer on user monitoring.

### Site monitoring

Monitoring your site is key from the early stages of building your website, but it should continue to happen throughout the entire lifecycle of your site. Each of the four pillars below plays an important role in laying a foundation for your site's success, as it will affect all four phases of the conversion funnel.

Succeeding in these categories requires technical implementation of best practices in the respective area, and they should be considered at all points during the development of your website.

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Site Performance</b></td>
        <td>How fast does my website respond to user interaction?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Site Accessibility</b></td>
        <td>Is my website usable by everyone in my potential audience?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Site Security</b></td>
        <td>How can my website ensure that user data is treated safely?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Site Reliability</b></td>
        <td>Is my website available at all times?</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

There are several tools available to monitor the above, most of which are universally applicable and not specific to your CMS. To provide some examples, for performance and accessibility you could use an online tool like [Lighthouse](/lighthouse-and-wordpress/), while for site reliability there are uptime services like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). Monitoring website security is usually done via paid services, such as a dedicated platform or an integration with your hosting provider.

For each of the above pillars it is most important to consider them from the very beginning of your site's implementation and follow best practices. You can learn more about [performance](/performance-in-context/) and [security](/security-in-context/) specifically in the respective web.dev section.

### User monitoring

Monitoring your website's users (also often referred to as "analytics") is a process that mostly kicks off once your site is live. While researching your intended audience's behavior on the web should be started early on in the conceptual stages of defining your site strategy, the monitoring itself can only happen based on actual users interacting with your site.

Each of the below categories maps to one or more phases of the conversion funnel, and the detailed analysis of them will help you refine your content strategy over time.

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>User Acquisition</b></td>
        <td>How do users get to my website?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>User Behavior</b></td>
        <td>What do users do when they are on my website?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>User Loss</b></td>
        <td>Why do users leave my website?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>User Retention</b></td>
        <td>Why do users come back to my website?</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

User acquisition and user retention map to the respective phase in the conversion funnel one-to-one. User behavior and user loss encompass both the engagement and conversion phase, with different implications though: For example, it clearly makes a major difference whether a user leaves your site before or after a conversion, such as making a purchase.

However, successfully monitoring your users is far less trivial than monitoring your site itself; the reason for that is you need to know what you are monitoring against. And this is what we are going to focus on throughout the rest of this article.
