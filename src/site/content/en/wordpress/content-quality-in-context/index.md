As we saw during our discussion about [success in the web as a content creator](http://web.dev/success-on-the-web-in-context/),  that a common denominator in all phases of the conversion funnel is creating awesome content that will be eagerly and enjoyably consumed by our users. In essence, content in king!

Your content strategy is very much unique to you and it is in part what differentiates you  from other content creators. But there are things that are independent of our voice and the specifics of what we want to say, and we can all leverage them to increase the quality of our content.

Content quality encompasses a very large space of things. In this section, let's discuss the main elements of content quality. The goal is for us to be aware, and get pointers to some specific areas we should make sure we are considering.

## Elements of content quality

In a general sense, content quality can be divided into three main areas:

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Value</b></td>
        <td>
          Great content bring value in different ways to users. Users get something that makes their lives better in some way by engaging with great content.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Search Engine Friendliness</b></td>
        <td>
          In addition to the value brought to users, content must be structured and composed in ways that are optimal from the perspective of Search Engines. We want our content to be properly crawled by Search Engines and for it to rank as high as possible in search results
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Content formats</b></td>
        <td>Attractive and/or effective commnunication style, with .</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


## Value

This is the part where our voice, perspective, and the specific niche we are creating content for, are very much unique to us, and being different is a good thing. In a fundamental way, great content meets the following:

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Is unique</b></td>
        <td>
          .
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Brings value to users</b></td>
        <td>
          Relevant information, or entertainment value.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Highly engaging</b></td>
        <td>Organization and intended flow of the content compel users to continue their journey of content exploration.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
