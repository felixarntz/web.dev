Tappable stories have become a major part of the way consumers engage with content. Nowadays, stories are interactive experiences on mobile devices that allow users to interact with full-screen visuals like images, videos, and text. They have emerged as one of the most delightful content types for users. 60% of weekly mobile content users now consume tappable stories daily on social media. 

The concept of stories was pioneered by Snapchat, and from there they found their way onto many platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp, and many others. This popular format, however, has mostly been limited to closed platforms such as Instagram, and those platforms own the stories created on them, control the monetization, and they are the only distribution channel

But, we have good news! We are very excited because now Storytelling is also possible on the open web!

Stories on the open web enable new dimensions to content creators:

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>You are in control</b></td>
        <td>
          You own the content, you completely control monetization, and you can leverage multiple distribution channels.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>You can leverage features that are unique to the web</b></td>
        <td>
          They can link to other parts of your site, they can be discovered by search engines, and they can be embedded in any web page.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Complement your web content strategy</b></td>
        <td>We can offer delightful story experiences intertwined with our overall web content strategy.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
